- suppose we have a network in which a fraction p of all individuals are male, and a fraction q of all individuals are female. Consider a given edge in this network. If we independently assign each node the gender male with probability p and the gender female with probability q, then both ends of the edge will be male with probability p2 , and both ends will be female with probability q2 . On the other hand, if the first end of the edge is male and the second end is female, or vice versa, then we have a cross-gender edge, so this happens with probability 2pq. Therefore, the test for homophily according to gender can be summarized as follows: Homophily Test: If the fraction of cross-gender edges is significantly less than2pq, then there is evidence for homophily.
