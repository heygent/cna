- Consider an ER random graph with n nodes and connecting probability equal to p. What is the expected number of the edges?
-
	- $$\frac{(n-1)}{2}$$
	- Average degree:
		- $$(n-1) \cdot p$$
		- When I count the degree I count every edge twice
- Suppose an ER has n = 1000
	- Does the largest cc have a number of nodes proportional to $n$?
	- Percolation threshold
- IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: average degree
-
- To verify the friendship paradox:
	- $$<k^2>/<k> \quad\quad> 1$$
- What type of graph is this?
	- check if it bipartite
	- bipartite have clustering coefficient 0
- Exercise 9
- Esercizio 11
	- edge list is convenient space-wise
		- adj matrix is always $O(n^2)$
		- edge list is $O(L)$ where $L \le n(n-1)$
		- in the real world, $L$ is usually much smaller than $n^2$
- Ex 12
	- max diameter $n - 1$
	- unless graph not connected, graph not connected has undefined or infinite diameter.
- 14
	- L max = n(n-1)/2
	- L max = n(n-1) for directed
