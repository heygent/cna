	- Consider the [adjacency matrix](((646275b2-7887-4bef-83fa-dbaf2a264cd5))):
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  0 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
	  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	  0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}
		- Draw the graph
		- What type of graph is this?
		- What can you tell about the graph [connectivity](((64368a97-8099-48bf-b424-298fc228d1bb)))?
		- What is the in-out [degree](((6422fb58-b14c-4f73-a8ce-c547d160c906))) of each node?
		- Write the [strength](((64368a97-7c8d-411c-a1ab-d08880fe1e29))) and degree of each node.
	-
	- Consider an ER random graph with $n$ nodes and connecting probability equal to $p$. What is the expected [clustering coefficient](((64625143-588e-4dc1-a991-4b27deea3a85)))? How does this result relate to the clustering coefficient observed in real-world networks?
	-
	- How many edges are there in a Barabasi-Albert network with 1000 nodes and $m = 5$?
	-
	- Consider a Cayley tree as the one shown in the picture in which each node has $k$ neighbours (called offspring). Starting from a central node, we build the tree forming $l$ offspring levels.
		- ((646e2d78-304c-4db7-8df6-989c39dc75a2))
		- What is the number of nodes as a function of $l$ and $k$?
		- What is the diameter of this graph?
		- What property of real world graphs is well captured by this model?
	-
	- Consider the following graph. What is its [diameter](((64368a97-9392-4dfc-8f6e-fc99ca2c919e)))?
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
	  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
	  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
	  1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\

	-
	- Provide an example of a graph with a structurally weak tie and motivate your answer.
	-
	- Draw the following graph and compute the clustering coefficient of every node.
